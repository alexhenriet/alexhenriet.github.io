<p>A smaller version of caniuse-db, with only the essentials!</p>

<h2 id="why%3F">Why?</h2>

<p>The full data behind <a href="http://caniuse.com/">Can I use</a> is incredibly useful for any front end
developer, and on the website all of the details from the database are displayed
to the user. However in automated tools, <a href="https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse/issues/1827">many of these fields go unused</a>;
it's not a problem for server side consumption but client side, the less
JavaScript that we send to the end user the better.</p>

<p>caniuse-lite then, is a smaller dataset that keeps essential parts of the data
in a compact format. It does this in multiple ways, such as converting <code>null</code>
array entries into empty strings, representing support data as an integer rather
than a string, and using base62 references instead of longer human-readable
keys.</p>

<p>This packed data is then reassembled (via functions exposed by this module) into
a larger format which is mostly compatible with caniuse-db, and so it can be
used as an almost drop-in replacement for caniuse-db for contexts where size on
disk is important; for example, usage in web browsers. The API differences are
very small and are detailed in the section below.</p>

<h2 id="api">API</h2>

<pre><code class="js">import * as lite from 'caniuse-lite';
</code></pre>

<h3 id="%60lite.agents%60"><code>lite.agents</code></h3>

<p>caniuse-db provides a full <code>data.json</code> file which contains all of the features
data. Instead of this large file, caniuse-lite provides this data subset
instead, which has the <code>browser</code>, <code>prefix</code>, <code>prefix_exceptions</code>, <code>usage_global</code>
and <code>versions</code> keys from the original.</p>

<p>In addition, the subset contains the <code>release_date</code> key with release dates (as timestamps) for each version:</p>

<pre><code class="json">{
  "release_date": {
    "6": 998870400,
    "7": 1161129600,
    "8": 1237420800,
    "9": 1300060800,
    "10": 1346716800,
    "11": 1381968000,
    "5.5": 962323200
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="%60lite.featurejs%60"><code>lite.feature(js)</code></h3>

<p>The <code>feature</code> method takes a file from <code>data/features</code> and converts it into
something that more closely represents the <code>caniuse-db</code> format. Note that only
the <code>title</code>, <code>stats</code> and <code>status</code> keys are kept from the original data.</p>

<h3 id="%60lite.features%60"><code>lite.features</code></h3>

<p>The <code>features</code> index is provided as a way to query all of the features that
are listed in the <code>caniuse-db</code> dataset. Note that you will need to use the
<code>feature</code> method on values from this index to get a human-readable format.</p>

<h3 id="%60lite.regionjs%60"><code>lite.region(js)</code></h3>

<p>The <code>region</code> method takes a file from <code>data/regions</code> and converts it into
something that more closely represents the <code>caniuse-db</code> format. Note that <em>only</em>
the usage data is exposed here (the <code>data</code> key in the original files).</p>
